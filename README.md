- Phase Portraits: Illustrates the system’s phase space and provides insights into the critical and ordered phases.

## Introduction to the Ising Model

The Ising model is a mathematical model used to describe ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. It consists of discrete variables called "spins" that can be in one of two states ($+1$ or $-1$). The spins interact with their neighbors, and the system’s behavior can be studied across various spatial dimensions to understand phase transitions, such as the shift from an ordered magnetic state to a disordered one.

## Renormalization Group Theory

Renormalization Group (RG) theory is a powerful tool for studying systems with many degrees of freedom, such as the Ising model. It allows the investigation of how physical systems behave at different length scales by iteratively reducing the number of degrees of freedom while keeping the important physics intact. Through RG, critical exponents and phase transitions of the Ising model can be analyzed systematically.

## Interaction Energy Density and Magnetization

The repository provides exact calculations of interaction energy density and magnetization, which are fundamental quantities for describing the system's thermodynamic properties. By studying these, we can understand how the spins interact under different conditions and how magnetization emerges or decays as the system undergoes transitions.

## Phase Portrait

A phase portrait is a graphical representation of the system's dynamics, showcasing the different phases of the Ising model. It provides a visualization of the system's critical points, stable and unstable regions, and the flows that describe how the system evolves.

## Usage

The repository includes scripts for performing RG calculations and visualizing the results. Users can run the code in `ising_model.ipynb` to compute RG flows, energy densities, and magnetization for different spatial dimensions of the Ising model.

## Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/erbilcanartun/ising-model-renormalization.git`
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
`cd ising-model-renormalization`
3. Run the cells in `ising_model.ipynb`, do experiments for different parameters and observe the resulting plots.
